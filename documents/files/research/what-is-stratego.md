## combat rules
when 2 pieces meet: 
1. the **attacker** moves onto the defender's square
2. both reveal their ranks
   - Higher rank wins, lower is removed
   - equal rank? -> both are removed
3. special cases
   - Spy defeats marshal when marshal is the attacker
   - miner defuses bomb, other pieces lose against bomb

## movement rules
- most pieces move 1 square at a time, only horizontal & vertical
- scouts can move unlimited in straight line
- you can't move in the lake (not jesus) or on other friendly pieces
- you must move 1 piece each turn

## game loop
1. each player secretly arranges their 40 pieces
2. players take turns to move their pieces
3. battles occur on contact with enemy pieces
4. game ends when:
    - flag is captured
    - player has no legal moves left (or no movable pieces left)
